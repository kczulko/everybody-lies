## RULE 1 (of FP data structures and algorithms):

# PREFER RECURSION WHEN CODING

## RULE 1A:

# PREFER IMMUTABILITY - NO SIDE EFFECTS
##### AT LEAST NO GLOBAL SIDE EFFECTS :)

===================================

### Culture corner: Referential transparency (by ```FP in Scala```)

```
An expression `e` is referentially transparent with regard to a program `p` 
if every occurrence of `e` in `p` can be replaced by the result of evaluating `e` 
without affecting the meaning of `p`.
```
